# Memoization

## What is memoization?

Imagine you have a friend who really loves your cake and asks you to make it for them. You follow all the steps in the recipe and make the cake from scratch. Your friend is happy and enjoys the cake.

A few days later, another friend comes along and asks for the same chocolate cake. Instead of starting from scratch and following all the steps in the recipe again, you remember that you already made the same cake recently. You recall the specific ingredients and steps you took to make it. This time, you can skip the entire process of figuring out how to make the cake because you have it memorized. You just reproduce the cake using the information you remembered.

In computer programming, memoization works in a similar way. When a program performs a complex task or calculation, it can store the results in memory (like a recipe) so that if the same task or calculation is needed again later, the program can quickly retrieve the stored results instead of going through the whole process again. This saves time and computational resources, just like how remembering the recipe saved you time and effort in making the chocolate cake for the second friend.
