## Context Menu

A context menu, also known as a right-click menu or contextual menu, is a small pop-up menu that appears when you right-click (or long-press) an item, such as a file, folder, or text, on a computer or mobile device. It provides a list of actions or options that are relevant to the selected item, allowing users to perform various tasks or operations in the context of what they're currently working on. Context menus are a convenient way to access frequently used functions without cluttering the user interface with too many buttons or options.
