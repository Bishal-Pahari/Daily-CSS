# Daily-CSS/JS

## Introduction
Welcome to the Daily-CSS/JS repository! This project is an exciting personal challenge I have undertaken to enhance my skills in CSS and JavaScript. The primary objective of this challenge is to learn something new every day for a continuous period of 30 days.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and showcase the various CSS and JavaScript concepts, techniques, and projects I explore throughout this 30-day challenge. By sharing my learning journey, I hope to inspire and motivate others who are also passionate about web development.

## Repo Structure
This repository is organized into daily folders, with each folder representing a specific day of the challenge. Inside each daily folder, you will find the code files and any relevant resources associated with the concepts I've learned that day.


## On Hold Due to Exam
I have put the challenge on hold temporarily due to upcoming exams. I'm committed to my studies during this period but will continue the challenge after my exams are over. Looking forward to resuming my learning journey!

## Next Steps
After my exams, I plan to pick up the challenge again and dive deeper into more advanced CSS techniques and JavaScript concepts.
