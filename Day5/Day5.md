# Lazy Loading

## What is Lazy loading?

Imagine you are reading an article that has several images embedded in it. Without lazy loading, all the images would load at once, even if you haven't scrolled down to see them. This can slow down the initial loading of the webpage because the browser has to fetch and download all the images.

However, with lazy loading, the images are loaded dynamically as you scroll down the page. Initially, only the images that are visible in the viewport (the part of the webpage you can see on the screen) are loaded. As you scroll further, additional images are loaded just in time before they enter the viewport. This way, the browser only loads the images that you are actually going to see, reducing the initial load time and improving the overall performance of the webpage.
