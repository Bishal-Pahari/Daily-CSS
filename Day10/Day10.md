## Using History API

The History API grants access to the session history of the web browser via the global object known as 'history.' It offers a range of valuable methods and properties that empower you to traverse both backward and forward within the user's browsing history and make adjustments to the stack of historical states.

- navigate through history
- manipulate the history with pushState()
- perfect for SPA (SPAs)
