## Skeleton Loading

Skeleton loading, also known as skeleton screens or placeholders, is a technique used to improve user experience during content loading in web and mobile applications. It involves displaying a simplified, empty version of the page's layout while the actual content is being fetched. This gives the illusion of faster loading times and keeps users engaged during the wait.
