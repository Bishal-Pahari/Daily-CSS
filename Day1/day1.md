# How to Send a Push Notification

## What is Push Notification?

Imagine you have a smartphone with various apps installed, such as a social media app or Web Apps. Whenever something important happens on one of those apps, like a new message or an important update, the app wants to notify you immediately. That's where push notifications come in.

Push notifications are like little messages that apps send directly to your smartphone, even if you're not actively using the app at that moment. They "push" the notification to your device, appearing as a pop-up message or a banner on your screen. These notifications can contain different types of information, like a new message from a friend, a special offer from a store, or a reminder for an upcoming event.
