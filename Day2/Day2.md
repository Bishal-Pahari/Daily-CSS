## CSS Scroll Snap

# What is Scroll Snap?

CSS scroll snap is a feature that allows you to control how elements behave when you scroll through a webpage or container. It helps create a smooth scrolling experience with specific points or positions where the scrolling stops.

Think of it like a book with multiple pages. Normally, when you scroll through a webpage, it moves smoothly without any specific stopping points. But with CSS scroll snap, you can define specific positions or elements on the page where the scrolling stops, just like when you flip to the next page of a book.

For example, imagine you have a photo gallery on a webpage. Without scroll snap, when you scroll through the gallery, the images may scroll in a continuous motion, making it difficult to focus on one image at a time. But with scroll snap, you can set it up so that when you scroll, the images stop at specific points, aligning each image nicely within the container. This way, you can easily view one image at a time without accidentally scrolling past it.

CSS scroll snap provides a way to create more engaging and interactive experiences on websites by controlling how scrolling behaves. It's like having predefined stopping points, just like flipping through the pages of a book, making it easier for users to navigate and interact with the content on a webpage.
